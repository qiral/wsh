## ⚙️ Configuration

WSH uses TOML configuration files for customization.

### Default Config Location

- Linux/macOS: `~/.wsh.toml`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.wsh.toml`

### Example Configuration

```toml
# ~/.wsh.toml

# Customize prompt (supports {cwd} for current directory)
prompt = "wsh [{cwd}]$ "

# Command history settings
history_size = 1000

# Enable/disable colored output
enable_colors = true

# Command aliases
[aliases]
ll = "ls -la"
la = "ls -A"
l = "ls -CF"
grep = "grep --color=auto"
..  = "cd .."
... = "cd ../.."
home = "cd ~"
```

### Advanced Configuration (Future)

```toml
# Theme settings (planned)
[theme]
primary_color = "green"
error_color = "red"
prompt_color = "blue"

# Plugin settings (planned)
[plugins]
git = { enabled = true, show_branch = true }
docker = { enabled = false }

# Performance settings (planned)
[performance]
max_history_memory = "10MB"
cache_commands = true
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

WSH is built with a modular architecture for extensibility and maintainability:

```
src/
├── main.rs        # Entry point and CLI argument parsing
├── config.rs      # Configuration management (TOML)
├── shell.rs       # Core shell logic and interactive mode
└── utils.rs       # Utility functions and command parsing
```

### Core Components

1. **CLI Layer** (`main.rs`): Handles command-line arguments and program initialization
2. **Configuration** (`config.rs`): Manages TOML-based configuration loading and saving
3. **Shell Engine** (`shell.rs`): Interactive shell, command execution, and user interface
4. **Utilities** (`utils.rs`): Command parsing, path handling, and helper functions

## 🛠️ Development

## 📈 Performance

WSH is designed with performance in mind:

- **Memory Safety**: Built with Rust's ownership system
- **Zero-copy**: Minimal string allocations where possible
- **Fast Startup**: Optimized initialization process
- **Low Memory**: Efficient memory usage patterns

_Benchmarks and detailed performance metrics will be added as the project matures._

## 🔒 Security

Security considerations for WSH:

- **Memory Safety**: Rust prevents buffer overflows and memory leaks
- **Input Validation**: All user input is properly validated
- **Safe Execution**: External commands are executed safely
- **Configuration**: Config files are validated before parsing
